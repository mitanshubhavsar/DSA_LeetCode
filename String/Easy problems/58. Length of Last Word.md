Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4

Code:
1) Using Split():
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        list = s.split()
        return len(list[len(list)-1])

2)Using trim/erase from right:
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int end = s.size()-1;
        while(s[end] == ' '){
            end--;
        }
        s.erase(end+1,s.size());

        end = s.size()-1;
        while(end >= 0 && s[end] != ' '){
            end--;
        }

        return (s.size()-(end+1));
    }
};

3)counting word length from end
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int count=0;
        int flag = 0;
        int end = s.size() -1;
        while(end >= 0){
            if(flag == 1 && s[end] == ' '){
                break;  
            }
            else if(s[end] == ' '){
                end--;
            }
            else{
                count++;
                end--;
                flag = 1;
            }
            
        }
        return count;
    }
};
