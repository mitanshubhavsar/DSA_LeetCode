392. Is Subsequence
Solved

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

1)Two Pointer (Optimal Approach):
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int i=0,j=0;
        string word = "";
        while(i<s.size() && j<t.size()){
            if(s[i] != t[j]){
                j++;
            }
            else{
                word += t[j];
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }

        if(word.size() != s.size()){
            return false;
        }

        for(i=0;i<word.size();i++){
            if(word[i] != s[i]){
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};

2)Similar Approach:
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int n = s.length(),m=t.length();
        int j = 0; 
    // For index of s (or subsequence
 
    // Traverse s and t, and
    // compare current character
    // of s with first unmatched char
    // of t, if matched
    // then move ahead in s
    for (int i = 0; i < m and j < n; i++)
        if (s[j] == t[i])
            j++;
 
    // If all characters of s were found in t
    return (j == n);
    }
};

3)By Recursion:
class Solution {
    int isSubSequence(string& s1, string& s2, int i, int j)
{
    if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    if (s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]) {
        return  1 + isSubSequence(s1, s2, i - 1, j - 1);
    }
    else {
        return  isSubSequence(s1, s2, i, j - 1);
    }
}
 
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
         int m = s.size();
    int n = t.size();
    if (m > n) {
        return false;
    }
    if (isSubSequence(s, t, m, n) == m) {
        return true;
    }
    else {
        return false;
    }
    }
};
