Hint
You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

 

Example 1:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
Example 2:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
Example 3:

Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"
Output: "x"
Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
 

Constraints:

2 <= letters.length <= 104
letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.
letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.
letters contains at least two different characters.
target is a lowercase English letter.

1)BruteForce (By Linear Search):
class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        int minchar = INT_MAX;

        for(int i=0;i<letters.size();i++){
            if((int(target) < int(letters[i])) && (minchar > int(letters[i])) && (int(target) != int(letters[i]))){
                minchar = int(letters[i]);
            }  
        }

        if(minchar == INT_MAX){
            return letters[0];
        }
        return char(minchar);
    }
};

2)Try to find whether each of 26 next letters are in the given string array.(By Hint):
class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        
        for(int i=1;i<123-int(target);i++){
            if(binary_search(letters.begin(), letters.end(),char(int(target)+i))){
                return char(int(target)+i);     
            }
        }
        
        return letters[0];
    }
};

3)Similar Approach:
class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:

        for i in range(1,123-ord(target)):
            if chr(ord(target)+i) in letters:
                return chr(ord(target)+i)     
        
        return letters[0]

4)Optimized:
class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        int left = 0; 
        int right = letters.size() - 1;
        char minLetter = 'z' + 1;

        while(left <= right){
            int mid = (left + right)/2;

            if(letters[mid] <= target){
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            else{
                minLetter = letters[mid];
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        if(minLetter == 'z' + 1)
            minLetter = letters[0];
            
        return minLetter;
    }
};

5)Optimized:
import sys
sys.stdout = open('user.out', 'w')

for letters in map(loads, stdin):
    target = stdin.readline().strip()[1:-1]
    left, right = 0, len(letters)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        left, right = (mid + 1, right) if letters[mid] <= target else (left, mid)
    print(f'"{letters[left % len(letters)]}"')

exit()
