441. Arranging Coins
Easy

You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:


Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1

1)BruteForce (Runtime error Overflow Integers):
class Solution {
public:
    int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long long i = 0;

        while(i*(i+1)<=2*n){
            i++;
        }

        return i-1;  
    }
};

2)Worked In Python:
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        i=0

        while i*(i+1) <= 2*n:
            i = i+1

        return i-1

3)Iterative Approach (not worked in c++ (overflow error)):
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1

        i=1
        sum = 0
        row_count = 0

        while sum <= n:
            sum = sum + i
            i = i+1
            row_count = row_count+1

        return row_count-1

4)Optimized:
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        c = -2 * n

        res = (sqrt(1 - 4*c) - 1)//2

        return math.floor(res)

5)Optimized:
class Solution {
public:
    int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        int count=0;
        int sum=0;
        int ans=0;
        int temp=n;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            sum+=i;
             n=n-sum;
            if(n>=0)
            {
                ans=i;
            }
            sum=0;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

6)Optimized:
class Solution {
public:
   int arrangeCoins(int n) {
	int ans = 0, row = 1;
	while (n >= row) {
		n = n - row;
		row++;
		ans++;
	}
	return ans;
}
};
