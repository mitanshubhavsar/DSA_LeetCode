Hint
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 45

1)BruteForce Recursion (Time Limit Exceeded):
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int total = 0;
        if(n==0){
            return 0;
        }
        if(n==1){
            return 1;
        }
        if(n==2){
            return 2;
        }
        
        total = climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
        return total;
    }
};

2)Similar Approach to Fibinocci:
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        idx1 = 0
        idx2 = 1

        while n>=2:
            idx3 = idx1 + idx2
            idx1 = idx2
            idx2 = idx3
            n = n-1
        idx3 = idx1 + idx2

        return idx3

3)Optmized in C++:
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int num1 = 0;
        int num2 = 1;
        int res;
        while(n >= 2){
            res = num1 + num2;
            num1 = num2;
            num2 = res;
            n -= 1;
        }

        res = num1 + num2;

        return res;

    }
};

4)Approach 2: Memoization
The memoization solution improves the recursive solution by introducing memoization, which avoids redundant calculations. We use an unordered map (memo) to store the already computed results for each step n. Before making a recursive call, we check if the result for the given n exists in the memo. If it does, we return the stored value; otherwise, we compute the result recursively and store it in the memo for future reference.

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n, unordered_map<int, int>& memo) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (memo.find(n) == memo.end()) {
            memo[n] = climbStairs(n-1, memo) + climbStairs(n-2, memo);
        }
        return memo[n];
    }

    int climbStairs(int n) {
        unordered_map<int, int> memo;
        return climbStairs(n, memo);
    }
};

5)Approach 3: Tabulation
Explanation: The tabulation solution eliminates recursion and uses a bottom-up approach to solve the problem iteratively. It creates a DP table (dp) of size n+1 to store the number of ways to reach each step. The base cases (0 and 1 steps) are initialized to 1 since there is only one way to reach them. Then, it iterates from 2 to n, filling in the DP table by summing up the values for the previous two steps. Finally, it returns the value in the last cell of the DP table, which represents the total number of ways to reach the top.

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }

        vector<int> dp(n+1);
        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};

6)Approach 4: Space Optimization
Explanation: The space-optimized solution further reduces the space complexity by using only two variables (prev and curr) instead of an entire DP table. It initializes prev and curr to 1 since there is only one way to reach the base cases (0 and 1 steps). Then, in each iteration, it updates prev and curr by shifting their values. curr becomes the sum of the previous two values, and prev stores the previous value of curr.

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        int prev = 1, curr = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int temp = curr;
            curr = prev + curr;
            prev = temp;
        }
        return curr;
    }
};
