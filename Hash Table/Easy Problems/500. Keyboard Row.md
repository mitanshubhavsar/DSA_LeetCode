Input: words = ["omk"]
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: words = ["adsdf","sfd"]

1)BruteForce using HashMap:
class Solution:
    def findWords(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        dict = {"qwertyuiop":1,"asdfghjkl":2,"zxcvbnm":3}
        ans = []
        for word in words:
            word_row = []
            for char in word:
                for key in dict.keys():
                    if char.lower() in key:
                        word_row.append(dict[key]) 
                        
            if len(set(word_row)) == 1:
                ans.append(word)
            word_row.clear()

        return ans  

2)Most Optimized:
class Solution:
    def findWords(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        row1 = "qwertyuiop"
        row2 = "asdfghjkl"
        row3 = "zxcvbnm"

        def can_type(word, row):
            return all(c.lower() in row for c in word)
        
        ans = []
        for word in words:
            if can_type(word, row1) or can_type(word, row2) or can_type(word, row3):
                ans.append(word)
        return ans
