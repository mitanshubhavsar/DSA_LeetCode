Hint
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

Example 1:

Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.

1)Brute Force:
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        
        total = 0
        for char in jewels:
            for item in list(stones):
                if char == item:
                    total = total+1

        return total

2)Using HashMap:
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        dict = {}

        for char in jewels:
            dict[char] = 0

        for char in stones:
            if char in dict.keys():
                dict[char] = dict[char] + 1

        total= 0
        for val in list(dict.values()):
            total = total + val

        return total

3)Similar approach:
class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        unordered_map <char,int> umap;

        for(int i=0;i<stones.size();i++){
            umap[stones[i]]++;
        }

        int total = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<jewels.size();i++){
            if(umap.find(jewels[i]) != umap.end()){
                total = total + umap[jewels[i]];
            }
        }

        return total;
    }
};

4)Optimized:
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:

        stonesDict = Counter(stones)
        x = set(list(jewels))
        count = 0


        for i in range(len(stones)):
            if stones[i] in x:
                count += 1
        
        return count

5)Optimized:
class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        int size1 = jewels.size() ;
        int size2 = stones.size() ;
        int ans = 0 ;
        unordered_map<char,int> mp ;
        for(auto i : jewels){
            mp[i] ;
        }
        for(int i = 0;i < size2;i++){
            if(mp.find(stones[i]) != mp.end()){
                mp[stones[i]] ++ ;
            }
        }
        for(int i = 0;i < mp.size();i++){
            ans += mp[jewels[i]] ;
        }
        return ans ;
    }
