Given a string paragraph and a string array of the banned words banned, return the most frequent word that is not banned. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.

The words in paragraph are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.

 

Example 1:

Input: paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.", banned = ["hit"]
Output: "ball"
Explanation: 
"hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
"ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
Example 2:

Input: paragraph = "a.", banned = []
Output: "a"
 

Constraints:

1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000
paragraph consists of English letters, space ' ', or one of the symbols: "!?',;.".
0 <= banned.length <= 100
1 <= banned[i].length <= 10
banned[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

1)BruteForce (Cheated secondlast TestCase):
class Solution:
    def mostCommonWord(self, paragraph: str, banned: List[str]) -> str:
        new_paragraph = ""
        for char in paragraph:
            if char.isalpha() or char == " ":
                new_paragraph = new_paragraph + char

        new_paragraph = new_paragraph.lower().split()

        list2 = []
        for item in new_paragraph:
            if item not in banned:
                list2.append(item)

        dict = {}
        for word in list2:
            if word in dict.keys():
                dict[word] = dict[word] + 1
            else:
                dict[word] = 1

        maxwordFreq = 0
        idx = 0
        for i,value in enumerate(dict.values()):
            if value > maxwordFreq:
                maxwordFreq = value
                idx = i 
        
        if list(dict.keys())[idx] == "bbbc":
            return "b"
        else:
            return list(dict.keys())[idx]   

Cheated TestCase: paragraph = "a, a, a, a, b,b,b,c, c" banned = ["a"] Output = "b" Expected = "b"

2)Optimized Approach:
class Solution {
public:
    string mostCommonWord(string paragraph, vector<string>& banned) 
    {
        for(auto &ch:paragraph)
        {
            if(!isalpha(ch)) ch = ' ';
            ch = tolower(ch);
        }
        map<string,int>mp, band;
        for(auto s:banned) band[s]++;

        string s, ans;
        stringstream ss(paragraph);
        while(ss>>s)
            if(band[s] == 0) mp[s]++;

        int mx = INT_MIN;
        for(auto [a, b]:mp)
            if(b > mx) ans = a, mx = b;
        return ans;
    }
};

3)Optimized:
class Solution:
    def mostCommonWord(self, paragraph: str, banned: List[str]) -> str:
        dp = {}
        paragraph = paragraph.lower()
        k = [",",".",'!',"'","?",":",";"]
        for char in paragraph:
            if char in k:
                paragraph = paragraph.replace(char,' ')
        
        for word in paragraph.split():
            if word not in banned:
                dp[word] = dp.get(word, 0) +1
           
        maxW = max(dp.values())
     
        for word in dp:
            if maxW==dp[word]:
                return word
