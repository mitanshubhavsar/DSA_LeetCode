You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

1)BruteForce Approach (Time Limit Exceeded):
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.size()-1;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<prices.size();j++){
                if(prices[j] > prices[i] ){
                    maxprofit = max(maxprofit,prices[j] - prices[i]);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxprofit;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
