Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:


 

Example 1:

Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
Example 2:

Input: rowIndex = 0
Output: [1]
Example 3:

Input: rowIndex = 1
Output: [1,1]
 

Constraints:

0 <= rowIndex <= 33
 

Follow up: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(rowIndex) extra space?

                else:
                    ans.append(prevans[i-1]+prevans[i])
            prevans = ans
            ans = []        

        return prevans
